For this project, simple linear regression, a supervised learning method is used to build a model that can predict a dependent variable or feature using one independent variable.

## Process

1. Create project repository named "datafun-07-ml" with README.md on GitHub.
2. Clone project repository onto local machine.
    ```git clone https://github.com/kwameape123/datafun-07-ml```
3. Create .gitignore file to indicate files or resources to exclude from source control.
    ```ni .gitignore```
4. Create project virtual environment.
    ```py -m venv .venv```
5. Activate virtual environment.
    ```.venv/Scripts/Activate```
6. Create requirements.txt to list project dependencies.
    ```ni requirements.txt```
7. Install project dependencies.
    ```py -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
8. Create jupyter notebook and begin project. Refer to "arnoldatchoe_ml.ipynb" for project details.

## Notes
1. Make sure virtual environment is activate whenever project is being worked on local machine.
2. ```git add .```,```git commit -m "message"``` and ```git push origin main``` whenever necessary.
